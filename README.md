# Spring-Damper-Model
These files are from my Dynamics and Controls Class, which is about equivalent to any course about vibrational analysis. 
These particular scripts analyze a spring-damper system in two ways, linearly and nonlinearly. 
State spaces are used to keep the equations seperate. First order numerical integration (Euler) and Second order numerical integration (Runga-Kutta) is also
used in modeling the system.
